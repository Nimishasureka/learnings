**Internal Mobility 1**: **Analyzing Promotability**

What do we do after hiring people for  a new role? Do we onboard them  and let them figure  their way ahead? One major challenge an organization faces is to what extent does success in a current role predict performance in the nextrole? 
Should we be screening just for are you good at your current job when we think about **who to promote**? Alternatively, what does predict success in higher level jobs? Should we just be thinking about are you impactful at your job? Or should we be looking at other aspects and traits as well? I think this is tricky thing to look at in many organizations.
The idea is if you could rate people on various dimensions of their performance inside the organization, then what you could look at if that  performance predicts how they would do at the next level. And more specifically, which dimensions of their current performance predict whether they are going to be a high performer in a high level job.

_Alan Benson and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota_  performed a study  by looking into  data on sales people. They had data on how the sales people performed and  on the ones that became sales managers. As they looked at data like what factors predicted promotions and what predicted the performance of  managers once they became managers, they found a few interesting patterns. People got promoted by being the best salesperson. Best sales managers were not only great at selling but also  very good at team sales and balancing sales efforts across their team. **To be a good manager, you need to be a good team person**.

&lt;p&gt;What do we do after hiring people for  a new role? Do we onboard them  and let them figure  their way ahead? One major challenge an organization faces is to what extent does success in a current role predict performance in the nextrole? 
Should we be screening just for are you good at your current job when we think about &lt;strong&gt;who to promote&lt;/strong&gt;? Alternatively, what does predict success in higher level jobs? Should we just be thinking about are you impactful at your job? Or should we be looking at other aspects and traits as well? I think this is tricky thing to look at in many organizations.
The idea is if you could rate people on various dimensions of their performance inside the organization, then what you could look at if that  performance predicts how they would do at the next level. And more specifically, which dimensions of their current performance predict whether they are going to be a high performer in a high level job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Benson and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota&lt;/em&gt;  performed a study  by looking into  data on sales people. They had data on how the sales people performed and  on the ones that became sales managers. As they looked at data like what factors predicted promotions and what predicted the performance of  managers once they became managers, they found a few interesting patterns. People got promoted by being the best salesperson. Best sales managers were not only great at selling but also  very good at team sales and balancing sales efforts across their team. &lt;strong&gt;To be a good manager, you need to be a good team person&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Internal Mobility 1: Analyzing Promotability</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">People Analytics-Performance Evaluation Week 1 continued</title><link href="https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/16/People-analytics-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="People Analytics-Performance Evaluation Week 1 continued" /><published>2020-04-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/16/People-analytics-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/16/People-analytics-post.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrapolating from small samples&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when we generalize an idea based on a small sample size ? Let’s look at an example to understand this better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we compare the data of two differently sized hospitals - a small community hospital which has 4-5 births in the day and a big hospital in a city which has 100 births a day, where are you more likely to see the population mean highly vary on a daily scale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have all girl births one day and all boys another day in a small hospital. This phenomenon is quite possible and hence smaller hospitals display higher variance. It’s unnatural for larger hospitals to display the same trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People believe small samples closely share the properties of the underlying population, but in fact that might not always be the case. If we draw conclusions on the basis of the small population we will neglect the role played by &lt;strong&gt;variability and chance&lt;/strong&gt; exhibited by the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we must double check as we follow our intuitions while dealing with smaller sample sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the implications for your organization&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental issue in performance evaluation, because, often, &lt;strong&gt;performance evaluation is based on small samples&lt;/strong&gt;. The smaller the sample is, the more we have to be cautious what kind of inference we draw from it. This is where data plays a big role, and hence we need to look at more historical data sources and larger samples!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wisdom of crowds - Signal Independence&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wisdom of the Crowds&lt;/em&gt;: this notion has become very common in recent years and it comes from a book authored by &lt;em&gt;James Surowiecki&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic insight is - the average of a large number of forecasts reliably outperforms the average individual forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the motivating example are the historical county fairs where you might have a large cow, for example, in a pen. And everyone who comes to the fair gets to guess the weight of the cow. Although most people make an incorrect guess, the average of their guesses is remarkably close. This is a fascinating insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if people have talked to each other before making their guesses in the same county fair?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a county fair, if everyone who walked up to the booth talked with each other before they made their guess, the value of the crowd would greatly diminish. As a result, their guesses can be very close. Therefore, all of these things break down the &lt;strong&gt;independence&lt;/strong&gt;, and decreases the value of adding additional voices to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If systems are designed in such a way that the voices are heard independently, we get closer to the truth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process vs Outcome&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance evaluation process vs outcome - let’s talk about how an organization not just cares about &lt;em&gt;what happens but how it happens&lt;/em&gt;, how a person goes about their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it does not mean that we become selfless. However, it means that the reward allocation to an employee should not only focus on the end result but also on the means or processes followed to achieve the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Let’s understand this with an example from sports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, when Shane Battier was playing for the Houston Rockets, and the Rockets were famously known for using Data Analytics. And Battier was famously a player, who despite not having any flashy skills or stats, he found ways to hang around in the NBA. Teams found him valuable, and he became even more valuable when he went to the Rockets. They started looking at the process, they started coaching him on - here’s something you can do differently to influence and create an impact in the game. &lt;em&gt;If you defend a player, for example, this way you’re gonna decrease the likelihood that he makes the shot. If you play offense this way, if you attack the post in this way, you’re more likely to score&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example tells a very interesting bit that we might not make a shot for the team to win but even if we contribute to stop a shot, we’re equally valuable in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battier believed that he can pursue an inherently uncertain strategy with total certainty. He can devote himself to a process, and disregard the outcome to any given encounter. This is critical, because in basketball, as in everything else, luck plays a role and Battier believes in making his own luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same lesson from Basketball directly translates to the corporate industry as well. There is documented evidence from a large number of firms where re-imagining the employee performance and evaluation has led to positive cultural transformations in organizations and grew employee satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This encouraged organisations to change their evaluation from a 100% results-based strategy to a 50-50 result and process based strategy. So they’re evaluating not only what the person does, but their impact on other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations now-a-days are starting to care a lot more than just results and numbers :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Extrapolating from small samples:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">People Analytics-Staffing Week 2</title><link href="https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/06/Staffing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="People Analytics-Staffing Week 2" /><published>2020-04-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/06/Staffing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/06/Staffing.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;staffing-analytics&quot;&gt;Staffing Analytics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the times during our team meetings or discussions, we come across questions like; how do we bring down attrition, or how do we engage the right people at the right job; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interestingly, we often end up with the statement, are we hiring the right people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should get the right people at the job - this means that we should hire the right people and allow them to work on something they’re passionate about and eventually also plan for their career growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring - Predicting performance&lt;/strong&gt; (we want to know who is going to perform best in the job)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hire a bunch of people, some of them work out, some of them don’t. A lot of people leave their jobs fairly quickly which suggests this was not a good match, and this pretty much happens everywhere. When you think about what hiring is; often we think about it as a match. &lt;em&gt;It’s almost like dating. It’s about finding the right chemistry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we find out the best fit for the role&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches that organisations use in order to try and screen applicants. These potential candidates are assessed based on the correlation between their interests and the job roles. correlation is basically a measure of how closely two variables move together. (correlation of zero means these things are totally unrelated to one another of correlation of one means they move together perfectly that they could almost be the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/learnings/images/Predicting performance.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Predicting Performance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked at the correlations, we understand that there are a number of things which  are good predictors of predict performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For ex:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to hire technical writers, maybe you’ll give them a description of your product and ask them to author a sample describing the product. 
Another very effective and surprising way  to test is the &lt;em&gt;cognitive ability&lt;/em&gt;, It turns out that general  intelligence is quite predictive of performance in a very wide range of jobs. Some organizations have candidates taking an IQ test, if intelligence is something they care about todrive performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another very interesting term which is being used by our famous psychologist- &lt;em&gt;Daniel Kahneman&lt;/em&gt;, which is called  &lt;strong&gt;Illusion of validity&lt;/strong&gt;, which means, a sense that we think we know much more about people than we actually do, this term here refers to a type of interview known as unstructured interview In these types of interviews, we meet someone and we talk to them. In the process, we try and get a sense of who they are, what they’re like, what might be their strengths and weaknesses. But, when we sit down and we talk to people, and try and figure out what they’re like is really giving into the illusion of validity, we don’t know or learn very much, but whatever biases, prejudices we have,  they fill up the whole room in our mind in terms of actually judging them. So unstructured interviews are found to be really pretty bad at predicting what people are going to do and how they are going to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured interviews&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, are interviews designed to assess specific characteristics of the individual, and understand if an individual has the attributes needed for the job. They’re found to be fairly predictive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine tuning Predictors of Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s understand how people analytics helps us predict people’s performance.
What people analytics allows us to do is go beyond the general idea, and start thinking for the specific job. It allows us to think -  what do we know about what makes people effective and what doesn’t? People analytics also helps us take an individual’s performance, and estimate how do they do at their job, and try to understand what the underlying motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex 1&lt;/strong&gt;: In a call center where we have huge amounts of data, People Analytics helps us assess what is the average handle time by a customer support executive absenteeism,  how does their availability look like. We could also obtain quality assurance and customer satisfaction service indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Some organizations spend a lot of money on training people. In such organisations, it becomes important to think about who is going to stay back in your organization for longer periods of time as it leads to higher return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very interesting point discussed in the course -  how do we predict who is going to be a &lt;strong&gt;high performer&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a nice story about JetBlue Airlines about how they have used People Analytics to make better decisions during their hiring process. So, when they hire flight attendants, one of the big questions was - is it more important that they’re friendly or that they’re helpful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They ran an experiment to figure this out.
They asked their customers to rate their flight attendants. Is this person friendly? Are they helpful? What do you think? And also to rate their overall customer experience. Are they likely to recommend JetBlue to somebody else? They assessed what factor between helpful and friendly contributed to a higher rating of the airline.   Based on the findings,  they discovered that  flight attendants being more helpful was more valuable to them as a business.  This enabled them to further fine tune their hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Staffing Analytics</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">People Analytics-Performance Evaluation Week 1</title><link href="https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/04/my-first-post.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="People Analytics-Performance Evaluation Week 1" /><published>2020-04-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/04/my-first-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nimishasureka.github.io/learnings/human%20resources/organizations/coursera/people%20management/2020/04/04/my-first-post.html">&lt;p&gt;I am a Human Resources specialist and since the beginning of my career in this profession, spanning for more than half a decade, I have been a People Advisor to various teams and organisations. One stark phenomenon I’ve witnessed in each and every team I’ve worked with, is the lack of proactive behavior from many HR specialists to propose new ideas and bring them to life. The primary reason for this is the fear of rejection. However, if there’s one big learning in my experience, it is this - Only innovation can bring big changes for the improvement of organisations. And it’s upto us to identify new opportunities, create clarity to the leadership, create a plan, demonstrate the potential Return on Investment and make a pitch! So, the right question to ask is, How can we come up with an effective plan for the organisation that will most likely succeed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this, it’s important to approach the problems in hand with an analytical bent of mind, use the right tools, create scientifically accurate analyses and communicate the insights visually to the right stakeholders. To learn this art, I have decided to take up the People Analytics course offered by the folks at Coursera. You can find the course &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this course useful because it covers a few very important topics like; performance evaluation, who do we promote, who shall we hire, how do we plan their career ahead and as we deal with the people day in and out, how can we work effectively together with the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sense, it touches upon the major topics to make use of data and analytics tools to inform decisions about how to manage people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First week of Training: Performance Evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us who are in the role of HR business Partner or People advisory , we often end up in a situation where it becomes difficult to decide which employee is doing better, the situation becomes even more tricky when there is a &lt;strong&gt;major overlap between Good performance and Bad Performance&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here comes the biggest challenge under the performance evaluation exercise-&lt;strong&gt;Separating Luck from Skill&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that there will be few factors which will be under the control of the employee and there will be few which will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Factors which affect employee’s performance outside of his/her control are:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Competitors&lt;br /&gt;
2.Team members&lt;br /&gt;
3.Boss&lt;br /&gt;
4.The economy etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The question here is;&lt;/em&gt; how do we separate skill from luck, the only thing which help us in separating skill from luck is &lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt; do you see persistence over a period of time? We need to be really sure and be reminded that even a &lt;em&gt;dramatically disparate outcomes can purely be the product of chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Punishment is better than the praise”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be understood by keenly looking into various situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex1&lt;/strong&gt;. When a teacher gives good feedback about a student’s performance, the student does not focus much on his/her studies while the other student who was given feedback of improvement he/she tends to spend more time on studies in the coming few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ex2&lt;/strong&gt;. In a study, it has been observed that whenever a Pilot is being punished for a poor performance during his flight they see better performance the next time, while whenever a Pilot is being praised for his good performance they see the worse performance the next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A parsimonious explanation to the above example could be that there is a little chance involved when a Pilot has a good flight or bad flight. So, when a pilot had a bad flight you would expect the next flight to be bad as well conversely a Pilot had a good flight you expect or predict the next flight to be better than the average. This is exactly why we have to be so careful about regression to the mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;but-as-a-human-we-are-hardwired-to-see-patterns-and-causality-out-of-everything-that-is-why-instructorsmanagers-feel-that-positive-feedback-has-detrimental-results-while-the-negative-feedback-is-what-works&quot;&gt;But as a human we are hardwired to see patterns and causality out of everything. That is why Instructors/managers feel that positive feedback has detrimental results while the negative feedback is what works&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression to the mean:&lt;/strong&gt; very brief explanation of this concept is that the extreme events are becoming diluted in the long run but it does not mean that they are evening out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if anyone is keen on understanding the idea of ‘Regression to the mean’, there is an excellent book written by, the none other than, &lt;em&gt;Daniel Kahneman-Thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I am a Human Resources specialist and since the beginning of my career in this profession, spanning for more than half a decade, I have been a People Advisor to various teams and organisations.

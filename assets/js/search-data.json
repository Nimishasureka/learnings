            "content": "Extrapolating from small samples: . What happens when we generalize an idea based on a small sample size ? Let’s look at an example to understand this better. . When we compare the data of two differently sized hospitals - a small community hospital which has 4-5 births in the day and a big hospital in a city which has 100 births a day, where are you more likely to see the population mean highly vary on a daily scale? . You might have all girl births one day and all boys another day in a small hospital. This phenomenon is quite possible and hence smaller hospitals display higher variance. It’s unnatural for larger hospitals to display the same trend. . People believe small samples closely share the properties of the underlying population, but in fact that might not always be the case. If we draw conclusions on the basis of the small population we will neglect the role played by variability and chance exhibited by the population. . This is why we must double check as we follow our intuitions while dealing with smaller sample sets. . What are the implications for your organization? . This is a fundamental issue in performance evaluation, because, often, performance evaluation is based on small samples. The smaller the sample is, the more we have to be cautious what kind of inference we draw from it. This is where data plays a big role, and hence we need to look at more historical data sources and larger samples! . . The wisdom of crowds - Signal Independence, The Wisdom of the Crowds: this notion has become very common in recent years and it comes from a book authored by James Surowiecki. . The basic insight is - the average of a large number of forecasts reliably outperforms the average individual forecast. . So, the motivating example are the historical county fairs where you might have a large cow, for example, in a pen. And everyone who comes to the fair gets to guess the weight of the cow. Although most people make an incorrect guess, the average of their guesses is remarkably close. This is a fascinating insight. . What if people have talked to each other before making their guesses in the same county fair? . In a county fair, if everyone who walked up to the booth talked with each other before they made their guess, the value of the crowd would greatly diminish. As a result, their guesses can be very close. Therefore, all of these things break down the independence, and decreases the value of adding additional voices to the process. . If systems are designed in such a way that the voices are heard independently, we get closer to the truth. . . Process vs Outcome: . Performance evaluation process vs outcome - let’s talk about how an organization not just cares about what happens but how it happens, how a person goes about their job. . In this context, it does not mean that we become selfless. However, it means that the reward allocation to an employee should not only focus on the end result but also on the means or processes followed to achieve the objectives. . -Let’s understand this with an example from sports: . A few years ago, when Shane Battier was playing for the Houston Rockets, and the Rockets were famously known for using Data Analytics. And Battier was famously a player, who despite not having any flashy skills or stats, he found ways to hang around in the NBA. Teams found him valuable, and he became even more valuable when he went to the Rockets. They started looking at the process, they started coaching him on - here’s something you can do differently to influence and create an impact in the game. If you defend a player, for example, this way you’re gonna decrease the likelihood that he makes the shot. If you play offense this way, if you attack the post in this way, you’re more likely to score. . The above example tells a very interesting bit that we might not make a shot for the team to win but even if we contribute to stop a shot, we’re equally valuable in the team. . Battier believed that he can pursue an inherently uncertain strategy with total certainty. He can devote himself to a process, and disregard the outcome to any given encounter. This is critical, because in basketball, as in everything else, luck plays a role and Battier believes in making his own luck. . The same lesson from Basketball directly translates to the corporate industry as well. There is documented evidence from a large number of firms where re-imagining the employee performance and evaluation has led to positive cultural transformations in organizations and grew employee satisfaction. . This encouraged organisations to change their evaluation from a 100% results-based strategy to a 50-50 result and process based strategy. So they’re evaluating not only what the person does, but their impact on other people. . Organisations now-a-days are starting to care a lot more than just results and numbers :) .",

            "content": "I am a Human Resources specialist and since the beginning of my career in this profession, spanning for more than half a decade, I have been a People Advisor to various teams and organisations. One stark phenomenon I’ve witnessed in each and every team I’ve worked with, is the lack of proactive behavior from many HR specialists to propose new ideas and bring them to life. The primary reason for this is the fear of rejection. However, if there’s one big learning in my experience, it is this - Only innovation can bring big changes for the improvement of organisations. And it’s upto us to identify new opportunities, create clarity to the leadership, create a plan, demonstrate the potential Return on Investment and make a pitch! So, the right question to ask is, How can we come up with an effective plan for the organisation that will most likely succeed? . To answer this, it’s important to approach the problems in hand with an analytical bent of mind, use the right tools, create scientifically accurate analyses and communicate the insights visually to the right stakeholders. To learn this art, I have decided to take up the People Analytics course offered by the folks at Coursera. You can find the course here . . I found this course useful because it covers a few very important topics like; performance evaluation, who do we promote, who shall we hire, how do we plan their career ahead and as we deal with the people day in and out, how can we work effectively together with the people. . In sense, it touches upon the major topics to make use of data and analytics tools to inform decisions about how to manage people. . . First week of Training: Performance Evaluation . All of us who are in the role of HR business Partner or People advisory , we often end up in a situation where it becomes difficult to decide which employee is doing better, the situation becomes even more tricky when there is a major overlap between Good performance and Bad Performance! . So, here comes the biggest challenge under the performance evaluation exercise-Separating Luck from Skill. This means that there will be few factors which will be under the control of the employee and there will be few which will not. . Factors which affect employee’s performance outside of his/her control are: . 1.Competitors 2.Team members 3.Boss 4.The economy etc . The question here is; how do we separate skill from luck, the only thing which help us in separating skill from luck is Persistence do you see persistence over a period of time? We need to be really sure and be reminded that even a dramatically disparate outcomes can purely be the product of chance . . “Punishment is better than the praise” . This could be understood by keenly looking into various situations: . Ex1. When a teacher gives good feedback about a student’s performance, the student does not focus much on his/her studies while the other student who was given feedback of improvement he/she tends to spend more time on studies in the coming few days. . Ex2. In a study, it has been observed that whenever a Pilot is being punished for a poor performance during his flight they see better performance the next time, while whenever a Pilot is being praised for his good performance they see the worse performance the next time. . A parsimonious explanation to the above example could be that there is a little chance involved when a Pilot has a good flight or bad flight. So, when a pilot had a bad flight you would expect the next flight to be bad as well conversely a Pilot had a good flight you expect or predict the next flight to be better than the average. This is exactly why we have to be so careful about regression to the mean. . But as a human we are hardwired to see patterns and causality out of everything. That is why Instructors/managers feel that positive feedback has detrimental results while the negative feedback is what works . . Regression to the mean: very brief explanation of this concept is that the extreme events are becoming diluted in the long run but it does not mean that they are evening out. . if anyone is keen on understanding the idea of ‘Regression to the mean’, there is an excellent book written by, the none other than, Daniel Kahneman-Thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman”. .",
